# ✨ About Me  

Hey! I’m **Haleema Yasir** — a curious mind who loves turning ideas into real, working projects.  
Whether it’s designing a system, building a GUI, or writing clean C++ logic, I’m all about learning and improving step by step 🌱  

## 💡 What I’m Doing  
Currently studying **Computer Science (BSCS)** and exploring how code connects creativity with logic.  
I enjoy working on structured, functional projects — the kind that make everyday tasks simpler and smarter.  

## 🛠️ Skills & Tools  
**Languages:** C, C++, Python, SQL, HTML, CSS  
**Tools / Frameworks:** Tkinter, MySQL, Unity, GitHub, Figma, Photoshop  
**Concepts:** Data Structures, DBMS, Operating Systems  

## 📚 Featured Projects  
- **Library Management System (C++)** – with queues, stacks & file handling  
- **POS System (Python + MySQL)** – a functional point-of-sale GUI  
- **Fraud Detection App** – built for an internship using Python  
- **Automatic Street Light Controller** – concept-based embedded system  
- **SQL Game Database Project** – multiple relational tables & queries  
- **Documentary Project** – focusing on giving food & shawls to the poor ❤️

## **Tech Stack**
C • C# • C++ • HTML5 • Python • MySQL  • .NET • Adobe Suite • Figma • GitHub 


## 🎯 Goals  
To keep learning, to stay consistent, and to create things that matter — no matter how small they start.  


## 🖤 Outside Code  
When I’m not coding, I like organizing, exploring new tools, and improving how I work.  
I believe in progress over perfection 💫
